## SearchForm Refactor

The `SearchForm` component has been refactored to enhance usability and streamline the code. Key improvements and changes include:

### Additions:
- **Dynamic Destination Suggestions:** As users type in the destination field, relevant suggestions from available trips are displayed, improving the search experience.
- **Improved Date Validation:** Enhanced validation for check-in and check-out dates to ensure logical date selections.
- **Simplified Logic:** Focused on core functionality to improve maintainability and user experience.
- **New URL Parameters:** The `HotelSearchPage` now dynamically receives `state` and `city` as parameters from the URL, allowing the page to filter search results effectively based on the user's selected destination.

### Removals:
- **Child Selection Options:** Removed the functionality related to selecting and managing the number of children during the search process, simplifying the form.
- **`DateInput` and `ChildrenSelector` Components:** These components were removed to streamline the form and focus on essential features.
- **`validateForm` Function:** The centralized validation function was removed in favor of inline validation logic, which may simplify the code but also reduces some validation robustness.

These changes aim to provide a more intuitive and responsive user interface while maintaining code simplicity and focusing on the most critical features.

    - Validates the form inputs and triggers the `onSearch` callback if the form is valid. Otherwise, it updates the `errors` state with any validation errors.

## validateForm Utility

### Overview

The `validateForm` utility function is designed to validate the input fields of a search form. It checks for required fields, ensures the dates are logically correct, and verifies that the number of travelers is appropriate. This function returns an object containing any validation errors, which can be used to display error messages to the user.

### Parameters

The function accepts an object with the following properties:

- **destination (string):**
    - The destination input provided by the user. This field is required.
- **checkInDate (string):**
    - The selected check-in date. This field is required and must be a valid date.

    - The selected check-out date. This field is required and must be later than the check-in date.
- **adults (number):**
    - The number of adult travelers. There must be at least one adult.
- **hasChildren (boolean):**
    - Indicates whether the user has selected to include children travelers.
- **children (number):**
    - The number of children travelers. If `hasChildren` is true, this number must be zero or higher.

### Return Value

The function returns an object `errors` that contains key-value pairs where the key is the name of the form field and the value is the corresponding error message. If no errors are found, the object will be empty.

## DateInput Component

### Overview

The `DateInput` component is a reusable form element designed for selecting a check-in and, optionally, a check-out date. It includes basic validation and conditionally displays the check-out date input based on user interaction.

### Props

- **checkInDate (string):**
    - The current value of the check-in date input.
- **checkOutDate (string):**
    - The current value of the check-out date input, which is conditionally rendered.

    - Callback function to handle changes in the check-out date input.
- **showCheckOut (boolean):**
    - A boolean that determines whether the check-out date input should be displayed. Typically controlled by the parent component based on whether a check-in date has been selected.

## ChildrenSelector Component

### Overview

The `ChildrenSelector` component is a form element designed to allow users to specify whether they are traveling with children and, if so, to select the number of children. It conditionally renders the input field for the number of children based on the user's selection.

### Props

- **hasChildren (boolean):**
    - A boolean value that indicates whether the user has selected that they are traveling with children. This prop controls the conditional rendering of the children input field.
- **children (number):**
    - The current value of the children input field, representing the number of children traveling.
- **handleHasChildrenChange (function):**
    - Callback function that handles changes to the radio buttons, allowing the user to indicate whether they are traveling with children.
- **handleChildrenChange (function):**
    - Callback function that handles changes to the number input field, updating the number of children traveling.

### Structure

- **Form Group:**
    - The component organizes its inputs within `div` elements with the class `form-group` to maintain a consistent layout and styling with other form elements in the form.
- **Radio Group:**
    - The component includes a `radio-group` div that contains radio buttons for selecting whether the user is traveling with children.
- **Conditional Rendering:**
    - If `hasChildren` is `true`, the component conditionally renders an input field to allow the user to specify the number of children. The input field is not displayed if `hasChildren` is `false`.

### Notes

- The component is designed to be used as part of a larger form where information about travelers, including children, is collected.
- Ensure proper state management in the parent component to handle the values passed as props (`hasChildren`, `children`) and to process the form data accordingly.
- The component can be styled or extended as needed to fit the specific design requirements of your application.

### Overview

The `Home` component is designed to handle navigation within the application. It leverages the `useNavigate` hook from React Router to redirect users to the search results page based on the input data.

### Functionality

- **useNavigate Hook:**
    - The `useNavigate` hook is initialized to manage the navigation within the app.
- **handleSearch Function:**
    - The `handleSearch` function accepts `searchData` as a parameter.
    - It uses the `navigate` function to redirect users to the `/search` route.
    - The search data is passed as state to the `/search` route, allowing the search page to access and utilize the provided information.

# Front-End Repo for Node/React Practicum

This will be the front-end for your team's practicum project.

It is suggested that you run these instructions **after** you setup the back-end server first.
You can go through these steps during your first group meeting in case you need assistance from your mentors.

You will have two folders inside one team folder (one for front-end and one for back-end). Name the parent folder something appropriate (in the below example we title it "Practicum Project").  Then clone directly (do not fork and clone) the front and back repos while inside the parent ("Practicum Project") project folder.

![folders](images/folder_structure.png)

>The front-end app (React) will be running on port 3000. The back-end server will be running on port 8000. You will need to run both the front-end app and the back-end server at the same time to test your app.

### Setting up local development environment

1. Clone this repository to the folder that was already created for both the front-end and back-end repos
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Pull the latest version of the `main` branch (when needed)
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server
5. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the data received the back-end server.
6. Now you have your front-end and back-end running locally!

#### Running the front-end server in Visual Studio Code
Note: In the below example, the group's front-end repository was named `bb-practicum-team1-front` and the back-end repository was named `bb-practicum-team-1-back`.  Your repository will have a different name, but the rest should look the same.

#### Running the front-end server in the browser
